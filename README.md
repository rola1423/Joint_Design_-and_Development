# 🔩 Joint Design and Development
  # 📐 Description
"Joint Design and Development" is a mechanical 3D model created using Onshape (a cloud-based CAD tool).

This project focuses on improving the durability and strength of a mechanical joint by increasing the wall thickness from 4.5 mm to 6 mm.
The final design is exported in STL format for 3D printing or mechanical analysis.

# 🧰 Tools Used
